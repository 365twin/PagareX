Cryptocurrencies have already changed the world over the past few years, but here at PagareX, we want to evolve things even more. While it’s true that many cryptocurrencies incorporate blockchain technology, several of them don’t use it to the best of its abilities. However, it’s the PagareX vision that investors have total control over their finances. This is able to occur because it works as part of a peer-to-peer community. Therefore, it’s a totally decentralised cryptocurrency ecosystem. Without banks or financial institutions involving themselves, all PagareX users have financial freedom. This also provides a much safer way of investing. Due to the decentralised system, identity theft and other fiat currency problems aren’t an issue.

PagareX coin holders will be able to make investments with such in a number of different ways, thereby increasing the value of the coins that they hold. These investment opportunities include Mining, Lending, Trading and Staking. The value of all cryptocurrencies is generally something that is determined by numerous factors. This includes supply and demand, perception and of course, factors of the economy. Because of this, PagareX coins and the blockchain market have extensive room to grow in a significant way. The sooner you invest, the lower the price of the coin, and then you’re simply able to watch it rise in value.

To put it simply, PagareX is a self-regulated financial system, which is able to provide multiple investment opportunities and financial independence to investors. This all takes place within the PagareX community, containing peers who are like-minded and able to push the PagareX brand to become the number one cryptocurrency around the world in the upcoming years.
